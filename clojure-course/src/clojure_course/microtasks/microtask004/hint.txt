Firstly, I suggest to encode long names of locations with short codes, for example, A, B, C...
Secondly, you may check several solutions:
1) week6\bfs_graph
2) week6\dfs_graph
3) week6\oregon_trail
4) week7\bfs_queue <-- this is the easiest one

It is up to you what metaphor to use to process the input dataset. It may be a graph, but also it can be a tree or any convenient concept.
