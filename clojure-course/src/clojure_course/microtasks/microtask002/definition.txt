Xavier the Wizard decided to grow and sell a gold dragon. When the dragon had hatched, Xavier realized it was green, not gold. The time has come to deliver the dragon to the buyer, and Xavier decides to take a desperate step: repaint the dragon. Let's calculate how many cans of yellow paint the wizard required.
You may split the dragon into rectangles: head and neck (2 m x 3 m), body and paws (5 m x 4 m), and tail (1 m x 3 m). For each square meter, Xavier needs two cans.
Fingers crossed for Xavier! I hope his trick survives the very first rain.

Try your best:
1) use a function for rectangle-square calculation.
2) you may put a pair of values in a vector and use it in a loop.
3) advanced: is it possible to use the "map" function? You may get documentation via "(doc map)" or check clojure.org.
